A news web application built using React.js that pulls the top news stories from BBC thanks to the OpenNews API.

## Project Status

This project is currently in development. 

Upcoming features planned include:

- user-login
- allowing users to "favorite" which news sources are their favorites and aggregate those sources together into one dashboard.
- letting users search for top stories from the different news sources (like CNN, CNBC, HackerNews, etc.)


## Installation and Setup Instructions

Clone down this repository. You will need `react` installed globally on your machine.

To Start Server, navigation to React app folder and run:

`npm start`  

## Reflection

This is a personal project I built to start learning React. During the course of this project, I gained knowledge of creating React components, passing props between the components, and rendering them to the DOM. I also gained familiarity with JavaScript's fetch api and processing the json data returned in the promise. 

Currently, the application uses the following technologies: React, HTML, CSS. 

The application was originally created using the start-react-app boilerplate to minimize setup time.
